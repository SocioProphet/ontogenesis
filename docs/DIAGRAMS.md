# Diagrams

These diagrams are narrative entry points into the ontogenesis ontology.

## Agentic Flow Architecture
- Maps: Intent → Context → Agent Identity → Policy → Evidence
- Ontogenesis tie-ins:
  - `ontogenesis.ttl`: core classes
  - `shapes/ontogenesis.shacl.ttl`: constraints (what *must* be present)
  - `context.jsonld`: JSON-LD surface for emitted evidence

## Agentic Flow Architecture — Human Digital Twin
- Human subject is the moral + authorization anchor.
- “Memory” and “Cognition” are typed subsystems (not vibes):
  - Memory = retrieval + provenance + access control
  - Cognition = planning over Intent DAG under policy gates
